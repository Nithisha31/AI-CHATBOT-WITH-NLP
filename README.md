INTRODUCTION
This repository contains the work I completed during my internship on AI Chatbot Development using Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this project, I explored how machines understand and respond to human language through simple, smart conversations. My goal was to build a chatbot that can answer questions, provide information, and respond naturally to user input—just like talking to a real person.

DESCRIPTION :

The main task during this internship was to design and develop a chatbot that uses NLP techniques to understand user messages and respond with accurate and relevant replies. The chatbot was built to handle casual conversation, answer FAQs, and assist users with basic queries.

My work involved:

Understanding user input using NLP (like tokenization, lemmatization, and intent detection)

Training the chatbot on sample data and predefined questions

Designing a dialogue flow so the bot can give logical and helpful answers

Adding fallback responses for unknown inputs

Making the bot easy to use through a chat interface

This task helped me learn how AI understands text, extracts meaning, and replies in a human-like way.

TOOLS & TECHNIQUES USED:

To build the chatbot, I used a combination of Python libraries and NLP tools that are commonly used in AI development:

Python – Programming language used to build the chatbot logic

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) – For basic text processing and language understanding

spaCy – For advanced NLP features like entity recognition and dependency parsing

scikit-learn – To help with intent classification using machine learning

Flask – To deploy the chatbot on a simple web app

ChatterBot (optional) – For rule-based or learning-based chatbot models

Git & GitHub – For version control and code management

These tools allowed me to build both the backend logic and the conversational interface effectively.

 EDITOR PLATFORM USED:

All development work was done using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Its powerful features like syntax highlighting, debugger, terminal access, and Python integration made it easier to write, test, and manage the project. I also used Jupyter Notebook to experiment with and test NLP features before integrating them into the chatbot.

APPLICATIONS :

AI Chatbots with NLP are useful in many fields. Here are some real-world applications:

Customer Support – Bots that handle FAQs and guide users 24/7

E-commerce – Product recommendations and order tracking via chat

Healthcare – Appointment booking and symptom checking

Education – Chatbots for student queries and learning support

Banking – Transaction details, balance checks, and loan info


Any place where users ask questions or need support, a chatbot can save time and improve service.
